            <p><strong>What's the meaning behind this piece?</strong><br><br>
            <em>SustainArt&mdash;Exploring the Nexus of Post-Modernism, Sustainability and Artificial Intelligence</em> endeavours to uncover the correlation between a recent art movement, an environmentally focused vision for the future and what could be both the method behind the next great movement in the world of visual art, as well as the answer to our planet&apos;s struggle with climate change&mdash; to tell their story through fine art, in the styles of 3 great artists from the post-modern era, and incorporating A.I. into the creative process.
            <br><br>
            <em>Centegrade 1.5</em> was inspired by artist Jean-Michel Basquiat, and painted in his unique Post-Modern, Neo-Expressionist style. It depicts a burning head, painted as the planet Earth. The painting is meant to illustrate something which must be avoided at all costs and something which we all play a part in preventing&mdash;The heat death of our planet.
            <br><br>
            1.5 degrees Celsius is the number of degrees above pre-industrial global temperatures which the Paris Agreement seeks for our planet to achieve to avoid the catastrophic consequences which climate change threatens, many of which can unfortunately already be seen around the globe.
            <br><br>
            Achieving this goal is something that takes each and every one of us to achieve. It's success is in the products we buy and the decisions we make on a daily basis. While we may be reunited as a part of the Earth one day, somewhere in a grassy field, unless we as a civilization make the neccesary changes, our children may not be around to do the same. Our world may not be their world, but their planet is just as much our responsibility as ours is theirs.

            <strong>What's the deal with Cadmium?</strong><br><br>
            The Crystal Palace is of great significance to art history as an architectural masterpiece and exhibition hall of the Great Exhibition of 1851, the first international exhibition of manufactured products and decorative arts. The Crystal Palace itself was a cast-iron and glass structure designed by Joseph Paxton to house the exhibition, which was attended by over six million visitors during its six-month run. Among the most popular exhibits were the Koh-i-Noor diamond and the Fould papyrus, but the exhibition's true significance lies in its role in promoting British innovation and manufacturing prowess to the world. It also established a tradition of international exhibitions that would continue throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, showcasing art and industry from around the world.
            <br><br>
            One of the most underrated, yet incredibly influential displays at the great exhibition was the display by Winsor &amp; Newton who had on display their  Cadmium Yellow paint.
            <br><br>
            Discovered in 1817 by German chemist Friedrich Stromeyer, Cadmium Yellow was first observed by chance as the result of an abnormal colouration of what was intended to have been zinc carbonate. The mineral's salt form, cadmium sulphide, gained attention in the scientific community for its brilliant and deep yellow hue the following year, and was experimented with until it became possible to manufacture at scale, leading to its exploitation as a pigment in the 1840s.
            <br><br>
            There are claims stating the the pigment had been used in oil paints from as early as 1829, preceding its public debut by Windsor &amp; Newton at the Christal Palace in 1851, but in its infancy remained extremely costly.
            <br><br>
            Some widely known artists who have been confirmed as early adopters of the pigment include the likes of Impressionists Claude Monet and Vincent Van Gogh. At the time however, it was a highly controversial pigment, not only for its price, but for its colour as well. Before Monet began using it in his work, William Holman Hunt et. al are credited with referring to it's colour as "capricious", often fading to "the colour of dirty beeswax". In light of its high price to the starving artist as well as its bold yet imperfect colour, most opted to use the cheaper and more readily available Chrome Yellow in their work, including Monet and Van Gogh.
            <br><br>
            As the pigment gained popularity in oil paintings, it made its way into the world of watercolour as well, seen in works from the likes of artists such as Winslow Homer &amp; John Singer Sargent.
            <br><br>
            By the end of World War 1, cadmium production had increased greatly and further scientific developments lead to a major drop in its price making for a far more affordable pigment, available in several kinds of paint as well as other hues, when combined with other minerals. Among these new hues, additional shades of Cadmium Yellow, as well as Cadmium Orange and  two shades of Cadmium Red.
            <br><br>
            The spread of cadmium pigment in the twentieth century is ultimately what lead to the discovery of its un-sustainability, as something that was both toxic to people as well as harmful to the environment. The pigment spread to the manufacturing world as a means of making brightly coloured plastics, overshadowing its use by artists. From its beginnings, cadmium was know to be toxic, although very low-risk once combined into pigment particles, unless of course those particles are inhaled as dust as in the case of soft pastels. Though this issue is easy to avoid, the real issue lies in your toilet water, or more specifically, sewage sludge, which is used as fertiliser for your food. Research has shown that cadmium particles can become concentrated in sewage sludge, which when used to fertilise crops, leads to an increased dietary intake of cadmium which can lead to certain long-term illnesses.
            <br><br>
            While the majority of concern are aimed at big industry, not artists, In response to the findings, bans on cadmium-based pigments have been put in place to reduce the amount of toxins entering the sewage system, and ultimately the environment. While cadmium paints are still available, many artists, schools and organisations have taken it upon themselves to avoid using cadmium pigments and turning to safer alternatives in favour of environmentally friendly  practices. 
            One testament to this movement or artists' environmental progressiveness is my election to incorporate Liquitex's cadmium-free line of acrylics, labeled with The Art &amp; Creative Materials Institute's (ACMI) seal for Approved Products into my work, ensuring a non-toxic product. This line of paints with this label means that I'm keeping myself safe as an artist, and I'm buying into the safety of our environment, as well as the health and wellbeing of everybody who eats food and relies on nature's water cycle.
